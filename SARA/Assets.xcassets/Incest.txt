Incest

If you’ve experienced sexual abuse by a family member you are not alone — and what happened to you is not your fault. While it may be difficult to talk about, you should know that this is an issue that impacts many people. The majority of juvenile victims know the perpetrator, and approximately 34 percent of perpetrators in cases of child sexual abuse are family members.1

While incest is often underreported, RAINN frequently offers support to survivors of incest of all ages through the National Sexual Assault Hotline. If you want to talk to someone confidentially about what you are going through, visit online.rainn.org, any time, 24/7 to speak with a RAINN support specialist.

What is incest?
The term incest refers to sexual contact between family members. Laws vary from state to state regarding what constitutes crimes of incest, child sexual abuse, sexual assault, and rape. Regardless of state laws, unwanted sexual contact from a family member can have a lasting effect on the survivor.

Why is it difficult to tell someone about sexual abuse by a family member?
It can be difficult for an individual to disclose sexual assault or abuse when they know the perpetrator. It can be especially difficult if the perpetrator is a family member.

What can keep a victim of sexual abuse by a family member from telling someone?

-They may care about the abuser and be afraid of what will happen to the abuser if they tell.
-They may also be concerned about other family members' reactions, fearing they won’t be believed or will be accused of doing something wrong.
-They may have already tried to tell someone what happened, but the abuse was ignored or minimized.
-They have been told by the perpetrator that what is happening is normal or happens in every family, and they don’t realize that it is a form of abuse.
-They may not know that help is available, or they don’t know who to trust.
-They may be afraid of getting in trouble for telling, or that the abuser will follow through with threats.

Where can I find support?

You may face additional issues related to your sense of safety and trust because this type of abuse often disrupts your primary support system—the family. The people who were supposed to protect and care for you may have caused harm or allowed the harm to continue.
